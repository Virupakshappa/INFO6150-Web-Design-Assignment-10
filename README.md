# INFO6150-Web-Design-Assignment-10
Built a weather forecasting application using REACT
Displays a 5-day weather forecast, showing high and low temperatures each day and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until weâ€™ve got everything rendering correctly.
The ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. And maintained the current view in the top-level App state.
Added React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
Signed up for a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/ (Links to an external site.)
Fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
